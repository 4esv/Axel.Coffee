Do you like coffee? **Me too.**

As a matter of fact, you could say thatÂ **I love coffee**. This website stands to show that, along with that idea I hope to share what I know and learn about the drink; and hey, maybe you'll find that you **love coffee too**.

In here, you *should* find posts relating to coffee as well as recipes for making coffee and coffee related items.
The posts should not be taken as anything other than my opinions, oftentimes informed by other peoples opinions. I am not infallible.

The recipes *should* provide more value as I have 4 years of formal culinary arts training which has helped me develop a wide skillset that I hope will translate well into this format.
Despite of my experience you *may not like what I like*, and thats okay; different people have different pallates. Feel free to adjust the recipes to your liking and to share them as your own *I wont tell if you don't*.

Lastly, this website is simple by design. My priority above all is accessibility as well as readability, this comes at a great cost at times but I believe it is ultimately worth it. We all need a break from [space cat gifs](https://media.giphy.com/media/paMVbhw7bnZLi/giphy.gif) sometimes.
